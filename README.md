# Jetpack Compose Practice Project

This project is a practice implementation of Jetpack Compose based on what I have learned from the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/) resources. The project demonstrates the use of modern Android UI development techniques with Jetpack Compose, focusing on creating a simple article layout.

## Project Overview

The project features a basic article layout with a header image, title, subtitle, and body text, all composed using Jetpack Compose's `@Composable` functions.

### Key Features
- **Scaffold Layout**: Utilizes the `Scaffold` composable to handle screen layout with padding adjustments for system bars.
- **Image Display**: Implements image display using the `Image` composable.
- **Text Styling**: Demonstrates text display with different styling options like font size and text alignment.
- **System Bars Padding**: Applies padding to account for system bars using `WindowInsets.systemBars`.

## Code Structure

- **MainActivity**: The entry point of the application, which sets up the theme and displays the main content using `Scaffold`.
- **ComposeArticle**: A composable function that organizes the article's content, including the image and text elements.
- **ArticleComposeCard**: A composable function that builds the article layout, displaying the image, title, subtitle, and body text in a column.
- **ArticlePreview**: A preview function that allows for visual inspection of the composable in Android Studio's Preview.

## Learning Highlights

Through this project, I have learned:

- How to set up and use Jetpack Compose for building modern Android UI.
- The structure and usage of basic Jetpack Compose components such as `Column`, `Text`, and `Image`.
- How to manage padding and insets with `Modifier` and `WindowInsets`.
- Applying themes and custom styles using `MaterialTheme`.

## Getting Started

To explore and run this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project to download the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the project on an emulator or physical device.

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements to this project include:

- Adding interactivity such as click listeners to the composables.
- Experimenting with animations and transitions.
- Expanding the article layout with additional components like buttons or a bottom navigation bar.
